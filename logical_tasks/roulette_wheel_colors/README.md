On the roulette wheel, the pockets are numbered from 0 to 36. Below are the colors of the pockets:

* pocket 0 is green;
* for pockets from 1 to 10, pockets with an odd number are red, pockets with an even number are black;
* for pockets from 11 to 18, pockets with an odd number are black, pockets with an even number are red;
* for pockets from 19 to 28, pockets with an odd number are red, pockets with an even number are black;
* for pockets from 29 to 36, pockets with an odd number are black, pockets with an even number are red.
