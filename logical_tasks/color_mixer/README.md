Red, blue and yellow are called primary colors because they cannot be obtained by mixing other colors. When mixing two primary colors, a secondary color is obtained:

if you mix red and blue, you get purple;
if you mix red and yellow, you get orange;
if you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
Write a program that reads the names of the two primary colors for mixing. If the user enters anything other than the names "red", "blue" or "yellow", the program should display an error message. Otherwise, the program should output the name of the secondary color that will result.

Input data format
Two lines are submitted to the program for input, each on a separate line.

Output data format
The program should output the resulting mixing color or the message "color error" if the wrong color was entered.

Note 1. If you mix red and red, you will get red, etc.
