Two segments are given on the numerical line: [a1; b1] and [a2; b2]. Write a program that finds their intersection.

The intersection of two segments can be:

* segment;
* point;
* an empty set.
Input data format
4 integers a1, b1, a2, b2 are fed to the input of the program each on a separate line. It is guaranteed that a1 < b1 and a2 < b2

Output data format
The program should display the boundaries of the segment that is the intersection, either a common point, or the text "empty set".
